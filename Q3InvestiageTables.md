### Reflection

1. How does the final ER diagram compare to the one you created manually? Is it exactly the same? Is there any difference that surprised you?

> The ER Diagram I made differs slightly in the auto-generated one. They don't suprise me, as they make sense as to why they happened. The first difference is that each player has one-to-many connections to their attributes in the autogenerated one while the manually made one was all one-to-one. Logically, each player should only have one-to-one connections to each of their attributes as they should only have one set per attribute, but the foreign keys automatically generated one-to-many connections in Django models.py

2. How does the effort compare? If I asked you to create and document a new database, would you choose to follow the procedure that we followed in our end-of-semester project, or would you use Django?

> If I were to create and document a new database, I would most likely use Django if it was a smaller database. If it was a smaller database, it would be much easier to understand and create, allowing me to skip out on making ER diagrams at the beginning. In my opinion, using Django is a much more iterative design model. Additionally, Django easily lets you visually interpret data in your database through its admin page. I prefer these things, so I would choose Django.
