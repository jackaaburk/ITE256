### Reflection

1. How does the final ER diagram compare to the one you created manually? Is it exactly the same? Is there any difference that surprised you?

2. How does the effort compare? If I asked you to create and document a new database, would you choose to follow the procedure that we followed in our end-of-semester project, or would you use Django?

> If I were to create and document a new database, I would most likely use Django if it was a smaller database. If it was a smaller database, it would be much easier to understand and create, allowing me to skip out on making ER diagrams at the beginning. In my opinion, using Django is a much more iterative design model. Additionally, Django easily lets you visually interpret data in your database through its admin page. I prefer these things, so I would choose Django.
