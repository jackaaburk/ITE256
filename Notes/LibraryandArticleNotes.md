## New York Public Library Article

- The New York Public Library is a library that holds a very, very large amount of books.
- This became an issue, and giant, off-site stacks were considered.
- Eventually, they came upon a solution of sorting books by size, which saved 40% of space.
- They had a paper the librarians could put books on to know their size classification and sort them accordingly.
- Because of this, books weren't sorted by Dewey Decimal, author last name, or genre.
- There is a database of these books that stores basic information about the book, and its exact coordinates and where to find it, making check-out much easier.
