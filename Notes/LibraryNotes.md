# Notes on libraries we've visited

> P.S. I don't actually remember completely what these notes are supposed to be on but I think it was on the library we were assigned to. So, I am noting on Montessori.

## Montessori Library Notes

- They use Dewey Decimal for nonfiction.
- They use author last name for fiction.
- They do not have any stacks.
- They have a small cache for a certain type of book that people check out all the time, and they do put the most checked out books in sections close to the front desk.
- They have a counter for how many books are checked out.
- They have a hold system for kids that acts a queue.
- They have a limit of checked out books for kids, 5 for older kids, 3 for younger ones.
