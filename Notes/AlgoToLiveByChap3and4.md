# Chapter 3 and 4 of Algorithms to Live By

## These notes will have a focus on the importance of sorting and caching, with examples of their use in libraries.

### Sorting

- Sorting is fundamental to computer and human organizations. It allows both us and computers to manage information easily. 
- An example of this used in the chapter is the inefficiency of Danny Hill's roommate's sock sorting strategy, and how it took him a long time to do what he wanted due to his strategy.
- Another example of this was shown in the US census in the late 1800s, their data got so large that it was very hard to manage without a proper sorting system.
- Another example of the importance of sorting is related to our daily lives, through technology, and the sorted lists it uses which help us access information faster.
- Chapter 3 emphasizes that sorting isn't just important in technology, but also in our daily lives, such as how we sort items (like the example of socks and library books).
- Another thing chapter 3 notes on is that it is sometimes better to leave things unsorted, noting that if it is quick to search there isn't really a point in sorting (it gives an example of bubble sorting with books).

### Caching

- Chapter 4 focuses on the importance of caching, or the process of storing data in a temporary location so that it can be accessed faster.
- An example of this in the chapter is an overloaded closet that needs cleaning, you must focus on what to keep (the important, commonly used data) and how to keep it (how the data should be stored).
- The data that isn't as important or commonly used in the closet example is the data that is not stored in the cache, as it does not require to be accessed quickly.
- Like chapter 3, chapter 4 links important ideas in computation to real life examples. 
- The reason caching and sorting is important in computation and real life is because of the time and money it saves. 
- Sorting saves time in the future, as you can more efficiently access data, and caching stores data that can be reaccessed more quickly, which saves time and money due to the data that does not need to be cached being removed from the cache, optimizing data storage.

### Examples of libraries used in the chapters

- The examples of libraries in the chapters display the importance of caching and sorting in a more obvious way to humans.
1. One of the examples used was UC Berkeley's libraries, with assistants who use their knowledge of the book's call numbers to return books sorted. 
2. There is a "rough sorting" area in the library, which acts as a cache because it is where the books that were just returned go, instrinsically keeping the most important books in this area for the most amount of time compared to other books (in a computational sense, this is the most important data spending the most amount of time in the cache), as they are the most commonly checked out and returned.
3. The books being sorted by call numbers obviously shows sorting, and shows how it makes the library more efficient, as books can be found easily.
