# Chapter 3 and 4 of Algorithms to Live By

## These notes will have a focus on the importance of sorting and caching, with examples of their use in libraries.

### Sorting

- Sorting is fundamental to computer and human organizations. It allows both us and computers to manage information easily. 
- An example of this used in the chapter is the inefficiency of Danny Hill's roommate's sock sorting strategy, and how it took him a long time to do what he wanted due to his strategy.
- Another example of this was shown in the US census in the late 1800s, their data got so large that it was very hard to manage without a proper sorting system.
- Another example of the importance of sorting is related to our daily lives, through technology, and the sorted lists it uses which help us access information faster (such as RAM).
- Chapter 3 emphasizes that sorting isn't just important in technology, but also in our daily lives, such as how we sort items (like the example of socks and library books).
- Another thing chapter 3 notes on is that it is sometimes better to leave things unsorted, noting that if it is quick to search there isn't really a point in sorting (it gives an example of bubble sorting with books).
