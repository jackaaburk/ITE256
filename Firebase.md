# Firebase Documentation

### What is BaaS?

- First, we need to establish what a "Back-end as a Service" is.

- A Back-end as a Service or BaaS, is a cloud computing model that one would use so that the backend portion of their app is already functional, primarily so that they can focus more on the front end part of their app.

## What is Firebase?

- Firebase is exactly that, a BaaS tool made by Google.

- Since it is made by Google, Firebase applications are quite scalable.

- Additionally, Firebase offers a selection of software development kits.

- Firebase was created to be easy to use and integrate with different frameworks.

- Specifically, I am focusing on the real-time database that Firebase offers for an application.

## How does the real-time database work?

- Firebase offers a cloud NoSQL real-time database, meaning it updates and synchronizes in real-time to every client being used by it.

- Whenever a client writes data to the database, the change happens immediately on every other connected device through WebSockets.

- WebSockets are persistent two-way connections between a database and client.

- Additionally, NoSQL, or "Not Only SQL" is a special type of SQL that allows for flexible datatypes to be stored that might not always adhere to the schema. It is a non-relational database that stores data in a non-tabular format.

## How it compares to PostGreSQL.

| Feature | Firebase Realtime Database | PostgreSQL |
|---------|----------------------------|------------|
| **Type** | NoSQL (JSON-based, hierarchical) | SQL (Relational database) |
| **Structure** | Schema-less; data stored as JSON | Structured; uses tables, rows, and relationships |
| **Querying** | Limited querying capabilities; hierarchical traversal | Powerful SQL querying, joins, and aggregations |
| **Scalability** | Designed for real-time synchronization and mobile/web apps | Scalable for complex queries and enterprise applications |
| **Transactions** | Basic transactions with limited capabilities | ACID-compliant transactions for complex operations |
| **Data Consistency** | Event-driven; eventual consistency | Strong consistency with transactional integrity |
| **Offline Support** | Built-in offline mode for mobile apps | Requires additional configuration for offline support |
| **Security** | Rules-based security model with Firebase Authentication | Fine-grained security control via roles, permissions, and encryption |
| **Use Cases** | Real-time chat, live updates, IoT | Enterprise applications, financial systems, analytics, large-scale data processing |

INDEX:

> - JSON is a plain-text, human and machine readable file format is used for data interchange.

> - Hierarchical databases are essentially trees used to store data, often used in web applications.

## For what kind of projects would Firebase be used?

### Since it has a real-time database, Firebase would be great for:

- Chat apps

- Collaborative project programs, like Replit

- Live data dashboards, like trading views

- Social media apps, especially with a NoSQL database that can handle a lot of unstructured data.

## Firebase Tutorial: Getting Started With a FireBase using Python

- To start, all you need to do is make a Firebase app with a real-time database.

1. Go to FireBase's website @ firebase.google.com

2. Click "Get started in console"

3. Create an app and follow through the creation prompts

4. After your app opens, under "Build" on the left hand dropdown, select real-time database, and create a real-time database on this page (I chose test mode since I am doing a tutorial).

## Firebase Tutorial: Connecting your terminal to the real-time database

- Now, we must connect your local machine to the real-time database in Google's web hosting

1. Download firebase_admin for Python, using something like pip install firebase_admin

2. Make a root directory for your project (name it to your choosing) with a .py file in it (with a name of your choosing).

3. Copy paste this template into the .py file, then obtain and replace the credentials to connect to your database in the database settings button on the web application. Additionally, the database URL can be found directly above the database console.
 
```
import firebase_admin

cred_obj = firebase_admin.credentials.Certificate('....path to file')
default_app = firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred_object, {
    'databaseURL':databaseURL
    })

from firebase_admin import db
ref = db.reference("/")

import json
with open("objects.json", "r") as f:

    file_contents = json.load(f)
ref.set(file_contents)
```

## Adding objects to your non-relational database

- If you inspected the template closely, you could find "objects.json" in a open() function, coupled with a load JSON load function and a set function.

- Through this, FireBase essentially opens JSON files with database objects and sends them to your real-time database that you are connected to. 

1. Knowing this, we should make a file named objects.json, or any named JSON file as long as you update the template to it. 

2. Now, put JSON objects in it. The file should look something like this:

```
{
    "Object":

    {
        "Attribute1": "Beep",
        "Attribute2": "Boop"
    }
}
```

3. Now, after running your main .py file, the objects should be sent and viewable in the real-time database. 

> Other FireBase functions can be used to remove and modify objects with remove() or update().
